Objects that are not capable of seeking always read from the current
position.  The value of the pointer associated with such an object is
undefined.
Upon successful completion, rreeaadd(), rreeaaddvv(), and pprreeaadd() return the num-
ber of bytes actually read and placed in the buffer.  The system guaran-
tees to read the number of bytes requested if the descriptor references a
normal file that has that many bytes left before the end-of-file, but in
no other case.
